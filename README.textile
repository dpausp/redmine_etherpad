h1. What is it? What does it do?

Basically the same as "this plugin":https://github.com/yourcelf/redmine_etherpad, but with authentication using the Etherpad Lite HTTP API. Both plugins can be used simultaneously.

h2. Installation

Navigate to:
@[redmine_install_path]/vendors/plugins@

Clone this repo:
@git clone git://github.com/draexler/redmine_etherpad.git redmine_etherpad_auth@
(The redmine_etherpad_auth in the end is important, otherwise you overwrite the old plugin.)

h3. Configuration

Add an "etherpad" configuration section to "config/configuration.yml" in which you define the etherpad host to use and the API key:

<pre><code>default:
  etherpad:
    host: https://etherpad.example.com
    apiKey: xyz...
</code></pre>

The rest works exactly like "the old plugin":https://github.com/yourcelf/redmine_etherpad
